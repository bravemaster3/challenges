# check program

Features:
* Check the presence of a non-empty README.md in the root folder and all subdirs: for now, checks only the root folder and the immediate children

Usage

Navigate to the folder containing the check.py program, and run the following
```bash
./check.py <dirname>
```

Alternatively, use the full path name of the check.py program
```bash
/path/to/check.py <dirname>
```
